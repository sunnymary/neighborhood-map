About the project
-----------------
This is project is a single page application about a familiar or intereseting neighborhood.

My project choose to look at the big companies located near Fort Worth, Texas. The app not only indicates the locations of the companys, but also digs further into the detail information of these companys and job postings. This app can allow a job-seeker or a resident to learn more about their economy environment of the neighborhood.

The app is built from scratch, using the method of Html, Css, and JavaScript, as well as JavaScript library - jQuery, organizational framework - knockout.js to build the main content. Third Party APIs, such as Google Map API, Google Place API, and indeed API are included to enrich the application.
